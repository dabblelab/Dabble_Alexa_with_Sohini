# Episode 04

### Thanks for joining in on the 4th episode with me! 

We built an Appointment Scheduler, using the Scheduling Skill Template, that [Dabble Lab](https://www.dabblelab.com/templates) owns. Which is quite available in the [Amazon Developer's Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask)

### The Scheduling Skill Template

Initially, move to the Alexa Developers Console & create a `new skill` using the `scheduling skill` template.

As, you change the invocation name (to your desired one) and build the skill, you can move to the code section & `rename the .env.sample to .env`

you may now change the environment variables with the values that you'd need from sendgrid. And then you deploy the skill.

I'd highly recommend you watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKPOcmVRAVU&t=801s) for this to know this better.

or you can find out my livestream to this [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vPHhPA1EMI&t=788s) .
