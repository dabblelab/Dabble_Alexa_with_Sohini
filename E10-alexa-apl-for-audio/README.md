# Episode 10 (Season Finale)

Welcome to this repo! 

On the final episode of Dabble Alexa with Sohini, I covered APL for Audio using a template that dabble lab owns and can be available [here](https://github.com/dabblelab/alexa-apl-for-audio-template)

For the next few steps, you can have a look at this [stream](https://youtu.be/84biWBPo6W8) . 

ALso, if you would love to follow a shorter process to understand the working of the APL for Audio Template you can stay tuned, as there'd be a tutorial up soon!

Throughout this episode I have used some formatted audio files that can be available inside the Assets Folder & you can access them.

I really hope you liked this season. The next season would be coming up really soon. Thanks for watching me on streams & contributing to our learning journey!
