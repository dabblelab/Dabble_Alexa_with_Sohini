# Episode 06

Welcome to this repo! This episode was really cool as we created a daily calm meditation skill using the Timers Skill Template, that [Dabble Lab](https://www.dabblelab.com/templates) owns. Which you can directly deploy to the [Amazon Alexa Developer's Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) using our One-Click Deployer at [SkillTemplates.com](https://www.skilltemplates.com)

### First step:

Navigate to [SkillTemplates.com](https://www.skilltemplates.com) and scroll down to template 19, which is the Timers Skill Template, click to deploy it. Hold on for a few minutes as it deploys the entire skill to your [Amazon Alexa Developer's Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) .

For the next few steps, you can have a look at this [stream](https://youtu.be/AE2ZOVKuBFg) . In this skill I have discussed all use cases & utilities of this particular template. You may find some of my explanations below.
