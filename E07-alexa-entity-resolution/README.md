# Episode 07

Welcome to this repo! On the 7th Episode of Dabble Alexa with Sohini we succesfully understood the working of Entity Resolution. And to better implement it & try out a skill the Entity Resolution Template was used, that [Dabble Lab](https://www.dabblelab.com/templates) owns. Which you can directly deploy to the [Amazon Alexa Developer's Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) using our One-Click Deployer at [SkillTemplates.com](https://www.skilltemplates.com)

### First step:

Navigate to [SkillTemplates.com](https://www.skilltemplates.com) and scroll down to template 17, which is the Timers Skill Template, click to deploy it. Hold on for a few minutes as it deploys the entire skill to your [Amazon Alexa Developer's Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) .

For the next few steps, you can have a look at this [stream](https://youtu.be/EJmFa9APuTg) . In this skill I have discussed all use cases & utilities of this particular template. 

ALso, if you would love to follow a shorter process to understand the working of a Timers Skill you can follow this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ksNpsrPd7Ro)

Since, through this episode we haven't used any external asset or resource, this is all we had for you.

Stay tuned for the next episode & please star this repo if you like it! Thanks.
