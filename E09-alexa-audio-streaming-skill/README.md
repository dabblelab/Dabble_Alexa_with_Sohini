# Episode 09

Welcome to this repo! 

The 9th Episode was fun for me! What about you? 

On this Episode, I covered the Audio Streaming Template & walked my viewers throught functionality, usecase, demo, testing & exchanged ideas on what this particular template can do!

## Points to Note :

#### 1. The Audio Player Interface is used in this skill, which unfortunately doesn't work on the Alexa Developer Console's Testing Simulator. This works only on your Echo Device.

#### 2. There are certain rules for your radio/podcast/streaming/audio URL, which needs to be followed effectively. Check this out below which i collected from the documentation site of amazon. This explains the rules you need to follow for your URL to stream properly. Also, make sure your URL isn't geo-restricted, as that way it would prevent your audio from being played in certain countries!
