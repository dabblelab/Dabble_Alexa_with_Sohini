# Episode 04

### Thanks for joining in on the 4th episode with me! ??

We built an Appointment Scheduler.

Initially, move to the Alexa Developers Console & create a `new skill` using the `scheduling skill` template.

As, you change the invocation name (to your desired one) and build the skill, you can move to the code section & `rename the .env.sample to .env`

you may now change the environment variables with the values that you'd need from sendgrid. And then you deploy the skill.

I'd highly recommend you watch this tutorial for this to know this better - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKPOcmVRAVU&t=801s
